## Components 
To make this project i used:
1. Arduino UNO,
2. 3 buttons,
3. 9g servo,
4. 16x2 I2C display,
5. Old phone in this case Samsung Note 3 neo,
6. microphone boom

## Additional info
To record the timelapse i used Framelapse app from google app store. But i guess any timelapse app will do. As far as i tested if you input same parameters in Framelapse and this device the intervals will be the same.
